    <p>
        Stretching westward, powerful gusts of wind and rain arrive at our doorstep. Following the meteorological trend of unusable roads and leaky roofs, an astonishing 
        <span class="highlight">12.7 inches</span> of rain came down in Doral.
    </p>

    <p>
        Ordinarily, in Miami, we see this extreme weather near coastline properties. We think of Hollywood, Jacksonville or Orlando; cities that normally sentinel and take the brunt of the weather’s force.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, as recent reports would indicate, the truth is to the contrary. From City Place Doral to as far as Miami International Mall, people are taking to social media to bring us videos of the effects of the rains. According to local UOM professor <span class="highlight">Dr. Donald P. Fleischmann</span>,
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “For this upcoming week, we see rain coverage peaking at around 85% — a value way beyond the normal. I mean, even with the way it is with the rain now – and it’s what I’m – what we can all see – I would not be going out right now.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Dr. Fleischmann conducts research in meteorological modeling, often lending computational resources to local news channels.
        <span class="highlight">The good doctor is right.</span>

    <blockquote>
        “It’s horrible, horrible. Really unthinkable. You know we always see people on T.V. that get stuck in some flood water in a street. We also see kids swimming in them and whatnot so we think, it’s not gonna be that serious, even in the worst-case scenario – but now there’s a bunch of debris jammed up under my car that’s gonna be quite costly.”
        <span class="quote-author">– Statement from James Garcia, aged 54, Doral resident.</span>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        James ventured through, what seemed at first to be light rains and puddled roads, before getting stuck in 87th Ave right before turning onto NW 74th street. Whilst dropping his grandkids to the Doral Academy, they ended up having to wait around 30 minutes for police assistance through the flooding.
